# What is SOCR?

The goals of the [SOCR Resource](http://socr.umich.edu) are to design, validate and freely disseminate knowledge. This Resource specifically provides portable online aids for probability and statistics education, technology based instruction and statistical computing. SOCR tools and resources include a repository of interactive applets, computational and graphing tools, instructional and course materials.

# How to use the SOCR Resources?

There are three major types of SOCR users: educators, students and tool developers. Course instructors and teachers will find the SOCR class notes and interactive tools useful for student motivation, concept demonstrations and for enhancing their technology based pedagogical approaches to any study of variation and uncertainty. Students and trainees may find the SOCR class notes, analyses, computational and graphing tools extremely useful in their learning/practicing pursuits. Model developers, software programmers and other engineering, biomedical and applied researchers may find the light-weight plug-in oriented SOCR computational libraries and infrastructure useful in their algorithm designs and research efforts.
